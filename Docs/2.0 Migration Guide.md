# TRON 2.0 Migration Guide

`TRON 2.0` is a next major release, written in Swift 3. It is supported on following platforms:

* iOS 9.0
* macOS 10.11
* tvOS 9.0
* watchOS 2.0

If you are looking for Swift 2.2/Swift 2.3 compatible `TRON`, please use `TRON 1.2.x` - latest release, that is written in Swift 2.

### Response serialization

`ResponseParseable` protocol was rewritten and renamed to `Parseable` protocol. It has a single method:

```swift
public protocol Parseable {
    static func parse<T:Parseable>(_ data: Data) throws -> T
}
```

This allows creating factory-like parsers, that support subclassed models, or use any parser that you want. `SwiftyJSONDecodable` protocol has been migrated to use `Parseable` protocol, so if you use it, there's no changes required.

`responseBuilder` property on `APIRequest` was removed, because all parsing logic can be now implemented directly using `Parseable` protocol.

### Encoding strategy

`TRON.RESTEncodingStrategy` is now a default one. This means that .post, .put and .patch requests will now have .json encoding, unlike before, where .url encoding would be used for all requests.

If you want to use old behaviour, you can set URLEncodingStrategy on your `TRON` instance.

```swift
tron.encodingStrategy = TRON.URLEncodingStrategy()
```

We recommend, however, migrating to `RESTEncodingStrategy`, because it follows best REST practices.

### Method naming

All API was adjusted to better match Swift 3 API design guidelines. Xcode built-in Swift Migrator should do almost all heavy-lifting, however you might need to review API changes manually in several cases.
